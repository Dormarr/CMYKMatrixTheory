<h1>Quay Code</h1>

Quay Code is a desktop based, open source CMYK 2D matrix code generator and reader. Currently it only runs on Windows but macOS and iOS development is underway. It uses dual binary encoding, meaning each colour contains 2 binary bits, allowing for potentially twice the data to be stored in each code. It uses Reed Soloman Error Correction for reliable decoding, and I'm constantly working on enhancing the CV capabilities for better and faster recognition of the codes.

It's still in very early development, but the foundations are there.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
- C#, .NET Stack/.NET Core 6.0 (double check), WPF, Visual Studio, Git, Original UX

<h2>Motivation</h2>

The idea began from questioning why there are no triangular QR codes, which fell into questioning the limited customisation of QR codes in general. The more I researched the more fun it seemed to create my own from scratch. I want to prove to myself that I was able to write the code from scratch, being a UX designer by trade and amateur developer by hobby. Though the triangular QR code has not yet come to fruition, the Quay Code is a project I am incredibly proud of and continue to develop and explore the use cases of.

Although I fiercly admire the global compatibility and ISO standards of QR codes, I believe we should have more options, more freedom and independence and variation in the technology we use. There is value to centrilsation, but also to customisation.


I've only recently made this public so this Readme is lacking, but I'll work on it!

##Planned Implementations
  - QR Standard alongside Quay.
  - Desktop Snipping for code recognition.
  - Improved computer vision capabilities and interaction with application.
  - Finalised standards of encoding and formatting.
  - Add settings.
